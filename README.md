# AlgorithmPseudoCode
# Word, Character, and Vowel Count

This algorithm code analyzes an input string, tallying the word count, vowel count, and total character count. The input string concludes with a period ("."). The program is a straightforward pseudocode-style syntax.

# Usage
Input: Provide a string when prompted. Make certain that the string concludes with a period to indicate the completion of input.

Output: The program will present the following details:

  1. Count of words in the input string.
  2. Count of vowels in the input string.
  3. Total count of characters in the input string (excluding the period).

# Structure
Sentence: Input string variable.
Count: Index variable used to traverse the input string.
totalWords: Count of words in the input string.
totalVow: Count of vowels in the input string.
totalChar: Total character count in the input string.

 # Code Explanation
 The algorithm processes an input string until it encounters a period. It enumerates words by identifying spaces and vowels (a, e, i, o, u). The overall character count is computed, excluding the period at the conclusion.

 # How to Run
Paste the algorithmic code into a compiler or interpreter of your choice. Run the program. Provide an input string as prompted. Examine the output, which includes the word count, vowel count, and total character count. Feel at liberty to adjust and improve the program as necessary!
